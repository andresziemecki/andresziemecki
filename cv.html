        </li>
        <li>
            Cleaned many Fraud Prevention rules <br>
            keeping the same metrics in production<br>
            by analyzing them and teaching ML systems on the Data Analytics team, so they can understand ML better and
            their limitations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Speed up Data Analytics research <br>
            by converting a manual task to automatic<br>
